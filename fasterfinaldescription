This is a faster method to calculate the triangular number with over 500 divisors compared to the method i have implemented in work2.py.
Here, it works with prime factorization. For divisor count of 1000 it takes about 20seocnds and for 500 it takes about 2.5seconds. The way it works is the number of factors that a number n has is the product of the powers of the prime factors +1

The link to the technique i have used to make it significantly faster is given above.
so, we dont find factors here and the class we have utilizes optimization techniques to find primes and the power of primes. 
Thus, 76576500 is the first Triangle number to have over 500 divisors.
